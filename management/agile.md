# Agile

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

## Values

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Principles

1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Best [architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Architecture), requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

### Scrum vs. Kanban

| Scrum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Kanban                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scrum **stresses on planning**. It starts with sprint planning and ends up with sprint retrospective.There are many meetings held which help to assure that the team is aligned with the next steps, priorities, and learnings from previous sprints. | Kanban is open to making changes on the go. It means there is less rigidity and **things can change frequently**.                                                      |
| It recommends collection of **time measurements** made during sprints                                                                                                                                                                                 | Kanban **recommends graphs** to get an overview of team's progress over time.                                                                                          |
| Scrum **no longer** asks for a commitment from teams. Instead, it is about the sprint goals and forecasts.                                                                                                                                            | Kanban relies on **time-boxing and forecasts**.                                                                                                                        |
| It stresses on planning, and so **estimation has a very important role** in Scrum                                                                                                                                                                     | Kanban has **no mandatory requirements** for estimation.                                                                                                               |
| Every **individual has their role** and responsibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                             | **No set roles so flexibility** in term of individual responsibilities.                                                                                                |
| The iterations/Sprints are fixed in duration. This duration varies from 2 weeks to 1 month.                                                                                                                                                           | Kanban is **not based on duration**. This thing is measured regarding Cycle times.                                                                                     |
| Teams are **required to commit** a specific amount of work.                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Commitment not necessary**. It is optional for teams.                                                                                                                |
| In this method, **cross-functional teams** are important as they can deal with any disruption that may cause a bottleneck in the software development.                                                                                                | Having **specialized team** is important.                                                                                                                              |
| It is **not possible to add items** to ongoing iterations.                                                                                                                                                                                            | New **items can easily add** if the additional capacity is available.                                                                                                  |
| A sprint backlog is owned by only by a **single team**.                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Multiple teams** can share Kanban board.                                                                                                                             |
| Deliverables are **determined by sprints**, which a set of work must be completed and ready for review.                                                                                                                                               | Products and processes are **delivered continuously** on a needed basis. So testing and review process goes on simultaneously.                                         |
| Scrum software development method **focuses on the backlog**.                                                                                                                                                                                         | Kanban method entirely **focuses on process dashboard**.                                                                                                               |
| Every **team member has a specific role** in Scrum master decide timelines, product owner set goals and objectives, and team members conduct the development work.                                                                                    | There are no pre-defined roles for a team. However, there may still be a Project Manager; the team is encouraged to collaborate and works together.                    |
| Best for projects with **changing priorities**.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Ideal for teams with **stable priorities** that unlikely to change over time.                                                                                          |
| Measures production **using velocity** through sprints.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Measures production using **cycle time** or the exact time it takes to complete one full piece of a project.                                                           |
| Scrum requires a **complete shift from the traditional model** to the Agile Scrum model that would be implemented the project.                                                                                                                        | Kanban **doesn't allow drastic changes** in the project.                                                                                                               |
| It is an ideal method for projects with **widely-varying priorities**.                                                                                                                                                                                | Best suitable for teams with **stable priorities**.                                                                                                                    |
| In Scrum, the entire **team focuses on to collaborate and complete the task** to provide quality development work.                                                                                                                                    | **Teams work to achieve goals** and reduce the time to complete the entire process. Thus, reduction in the time cycle is biggest indicators of success here.           |
| Scrum **emphasis on its schedules**; new items cannot be added to ongoing iterations.                                                                                                                                                                 | Kanban is more iterative by nature as it **does not have specific timeframes**. So that, new items can be continually added whenever additional capacity is available. |
| The total work is done in **batches/Sprints**.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The entire project is performed on the movement of **single-threaded work item flows**.                                                                                |
| **Scrum master** acts as a problem solver.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Kanban encourages **every team member is a leader** and sharing responsibility amongst them all.                                                                       |
| Scrum prescribes **time-boxed iterations**.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Kanban focuses on **planning a different duration** for individual iteration.                                                                                          |
| Scrum helps firms to **save time and money**.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Kanban method **focus on continuous improvement**, productivity, and efficiency.                                                                                       |
| Achieve **stable and consistent communication** of performance at all levels.                                                                                                                                                                         | Team members are more likely to **accomplish their goals much easier** because of visual nature of Kanban boards.                                                      |
| Project are **coded and tested during the sprint** review                                                                                                                                                                                             | Team members are more likely to **accomplish their goals much easier** because of visual nature of Kanban boards.                                                      |
| It is **easier to adapt to the constant changes** because of the short sprints and regular feedback.                                                                                                                                                  | It is **designed for a regular, steady output**, major changes in customer demand can make Kanban fail.                                                                |
| The total cost of the project is minimal which may lead to **quicker and cheaper result**.                                                                                                                                                            | If a task is not correctly estimated, the **total project cost will never be accurate**. In such cases, the task can be spread over several sprints.                   |
| This methodology **requires experienced team members** only. So, If the team consists of people who are not an expert, the project cannot be completed in time.                                                                                       | **No specific timeframes** are allocated with each phase, so team members never get the idea how much time they can take in every phase.                               |
| In this Agile Scrum method, it is **easier to deliver a quality product** at a scheduled time.                                                                                                                                                        | It is designed for a **regular, steady output**, major changes in customer demand can make Kanban fall.                                                                |
| The **project plan will never disturb** even if a team member leaves the team.                                                                                                                                                                        | If any of the team members exit during development, it can **hurt the project development**.                                                                           |
| Daily meetings sometimes **frustrate** team members.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Outdated Kanban board** can lead to issues in the development process.                                                                                               |
| **Large projects can easily divided** into easily manageable sprints.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Only **works well with small teams** so not suitable large size team.                                                                                                  |

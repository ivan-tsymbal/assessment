- [SOLID](http://howtodoinjava.com/best-practices/5-class-design-principles-solid-in-java/)
  - Single Responsibility Principle - One class should have one and only one responsibility
  - Open Closed Principle - Software components should be open for extension, but closed for modification
  - Liskov’s Substitution Principle - Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types
  - Interface Segregation Principle - Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use
  - Dependency Inversion Principle - Depend on abstractions, not on concretions
- [KISS](https://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html) - Keep It Stupid Simple
- DRY - Do not repeat yourself
- Yagni - You aren't gonna need it
- Law of Demeter (LoD)
- Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units “closely” related to the current unit.
- Each unit should only talk to its friends; don’t talk to strangers.
- Only talk to your immediate friends.
- Composition over inheritance
- Favor readability
- Practice consistency

# Quality attributes

## Design qualities

| Quality attribute    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conceptual Integrity | Conceptual integrity defines the consistency and coherence of the overall design. This includes the way that components or modules are designed, as well as such factors as the coding style and variable naming.                 |
| Maintainability      | Maintainability is the ability of the system to change easily. Changes can impact components, services, features, and interfaces when adding or changing the functionality, fixing errors, and meeting new business requirements. |
| Reusability          | Reusability defines the capability for components and subsystems to be suitable for use in other applications and in other scenarios. Reusability minimizes the duplication of components and the implementation time.            |

## Run-time qualities

| Quality attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Availability      | Availability defines the proportion of time that the system is functional and working. It can be measured as a percentage of the total system downtime over a predefined period. Availability is affected by system errors, infrastructure issues, malicious attacks, and system load.                            |
| Interoperability  | Interoperability is the ability of a system or different systems to operate successfully by communicating and exchanging information with other external systems written and run by external parties. An interoperable system makes it easier to exchange and reuse information internally as well as externally. |
| Manageability     | Manageability defines how easy it is for system administrators to manage the application, usually through sufficient and useful instrumentation exposed for use in monitoring systems and for debugging and performance tuning.                                                                                   |
| Performance       | Performance is an indication of the responsiveness of a system to execute any action within a given time interval. It can be measured in terms of latency or throughput. Latency is the time required to respond to any event. Throughput is the number of events that take place within a given amount of time.  |
| Reliability       | Reliability is the ability of a system to remain operational over time. Reliability is measured as the probability that a system will not fail to perform its intended functions over a specified time interval.                                                                                                  |
| Scalability       | Scalability is ability of a system to either handle increases in load without impact on the performance of the system, or the ability to be readily enlarged.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Security          | Security is the capability of a system to prevent malicious or accidental actions outside of the designed usage, and to prevent disclosure or loss of information. A secure system aims to protect assets and prevent unauthorized modification of information.                                                   |

## System qualities

| Quality attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supportability    | Supportability is the ability of the system to provide information helpful for identifying and resolving issues when it fails to work correctly.                                                                                                                                                |
| Testability       | Testability is a measure of how easy it is to create test criteria for the system and its components, and to execute these tests in order to determine if the criteria are met. Good testability makes it more likely that faults in a system can be isolated in a timely and effective manner. |

## User qualities

| Quality attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Usability         | Usability defines how well the application meets the requirements of the user and consumer by being intuitive, easy to localize and globalize, providing good access for disabled users, and resulting in a good overall user experience. |

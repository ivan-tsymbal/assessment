# REST

[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (REpresntational State Transfer) is an architectural style of developing web services which take advantage of ubiquity of HTTP protocol and leverages HTTP method to define actions.

Architectural principles

- performance in component interactions, which can be the dominant factor in user-perceived performance and network efficiency;
- scalability allowing the support of large numbers of components and interactions among components;
- simplicity of a uniform interface;
- modifiability of components to meet changing needs (even while the application is running);
- visibility of communication between components by service agents;
- portability of components by moving program code with the data;
- reliability in the resistance to failure at the system level in the presence of failures within components, connectors, or data

Constrains

- Client-server architecture
- Statelessness
- Cacheability
- Layered system
- Code on demand
- Uniform interface (resource identification in requests; resource manipulation through representations; self-descreptive messages; hipermedia as the engine of application state)
